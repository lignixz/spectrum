## Simple expressions grammar

A simple expressions grammar is a grammar defined in identities and operators. 
Expressions are constructed based on identities and operator rules. A single identity is a valid expression. Operators are combinators element, that can form valid expressions by combining with identities:

* identities: symbols that are valid expression by itself.

* operators: symbols that combines with identities or expressions to form valid expressions.
